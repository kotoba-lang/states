(ns states.json
  "JSON ↔ EDN conversion for the ASL (Amazon States Language) model.

  `from-data` converts an already-parsed Clojure map (string keys, ASL JSON shape)
  into the namespaced EDN model used by states-clj. `to-data` is the reverse,
  producing a string-keyed map suitable for JSON serialisation.

  Neither function performs I/O — pass the result of your host's JSON parser (e.g.
  `clojure.data.json/read-str` on the JVM) in, get EDN out.")
